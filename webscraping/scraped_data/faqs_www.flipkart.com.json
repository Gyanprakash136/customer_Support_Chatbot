    "answer": "Gone are the days when the jewellery you wore was a reflection of your status symbol. Today, it completely depends on what you want to flaunt, and not what others want to see. While most of the brides-to-be like to keep it traditional by opting for precious jewellery sets, there are others who believe that akundan jewelleryset can complement their outfit to the hilt. It is a good thing to have at least one precious set in your wardrobe, as it is more of an emotional investment rather than a monetary one. Diamond, gold, platinum and silver jewellery sets are popular choices when it comes to precious ornaments. Artificial antique jewellery can vary from kundan to ceramic. So choose one which will serve your purpose, and you are good to go."

LCD TV sets come with a backlight that is needed to light up liquid crystals to form an image. This backlight affects pixels around it, preventing the TV to attain true blacks. On the other hand, OLED televisions are made up of pixels that emit light on their own and so can become pitch black when turned off. OLED also comes with a white pixel in addition to blue, green and red pixels - this ensures greater contrast and varied colours on your screen. A remarkably wide viewing angle is another aspect that helps OLED triumph overLED televisions."

    "answer": "An air conditioner works almost on the same principle as a refrigerator. However, unlike a refrigerator that takes heat away from the items stored within it, an air conditioner absorbs the heat from an entire room. This helps reduce the temperature within the room. This process is done with the help of a chemical called refrigerant. During the cooling process, the indoor unit (IDU) of the air conditioner produces waste water which is drained out.Now that you know how an air conditioner functions, let us take a look at some of the most common types of air conditioners available in India."
